# EvolveMe 🌱 - Your AI Wellness Companion

**A Submission for the Bolt.new Hackathon - Summer 2024**

EvolveMe is a next-generation self-development application designed to help you grow, meditate, and achieve your goals through an evolving, AI-powered virtual companion. Our mission is to make the journey to a better self interactive, engaging, and deeply personal.

This project was imagined and built entirely with **Bolt.new**, demonstrating the power of creating complex, production-ready applications without a single line of traditional code.

## 💡 The Idea

In a world filled with stress and pressure, taking care of your mental and physical health is essential. EvolveMe is not just another wellness app; it's a partner in your growth.

The core concept is an **interactive 3D mascot** that grows and evolves based on your positive actions within the app. Every meditation session, journal entry, and completed physical exercise nourishes your companion, leveling it up to a new stage of its evolution. It's a visual and rewarding representation of your own progress.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Evolving Mascot (`EvolveMascot3D`)**: Watch your personal companion grow and transform in 3D as you advance on your wellness journey.
*   **Guided Sessions (`MeditationSession`, `MusicSession`, `PhysicalExercise`)**: Access a library of meditation sessions, relaxing soundscapes, and simple physical exercise routines.
*   **AI-Powered Journal (`JournalScreen`, `aiService`)**: Express your thoughts and feelings in a smart journal. Our AI analyzes your entries (privately and securely) to offer insights and encouragement.
*   **Interactive Coaching (`InteractiveChat`, `TrainingChat`)**: Chat with your AI guide to set goals, overcome blocks, or simply talk when you need to.
*   **Voice Guide (`VoiceGuide`)**: Enjoy an immersive experience with meditations and instructions guided by a soothing, natural-sounding AI voice.
*   **Vision Board (`VisionScreen`)**: Create a digital vision board to visualize your dreams and stay motivated.
*   **Profile & Tracking (`ProfileScreen`)**: Track your progress, streaks, and your mascot's evolutionary milestones.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project showcases the "build without code" philosophy of the hackathon.

*   **Core Platform**: **Bolt.new** was used for the entire development process, from UI design to application logic.
*   **Frontend**: The app is built on a **React (with TypeScript)** foundation and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, all orchestrated by the Bolt.new environment.
*   **AI Services**:
    *   A custom service (`aiService.ts`) handles interactions with language models for chat and journal analysis.
    *   **Tackling the Voice AI Challenge**: Integrating **ElevenLabs** for the `VoiceGuide` feature.
*   **Backend & Deployment**:
    *   **Tackling the Startup Challenge**: Using **Supabase** to manage user data, profiles, and progress, preparing the project to scale.
    *   **Tackling the Deployment Challenge**: Using **Netlify** for simple and effective full-stack deployment.
